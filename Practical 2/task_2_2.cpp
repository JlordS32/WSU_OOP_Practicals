/*  Task 2.2
    
    Write a function that takes two integers, numerator and denominator, as input
    parameters and output their quotient and remainder. Use a main function test the
    function.

    Hint: Use call by reference to output the quotient and remainder as parameters (see an
    example for Code for Lecture 2 (TwoDigits.cpp). Use the following formula to
    calculate quotient and remainder:

    quotient = numerator / denominator;
    remainder = numerator % denominator;
